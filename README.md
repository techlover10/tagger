# Tagger 
by Jared **"Bayou"** Wong

Small library written in NLTK + Python with tremendous potential.  Categorizes data from various sources of written work and a set of dictionaries into a single comprehensive Markov matrix, and is able to reproduce the tone of the input works with randomly generated text (using probabilities generated from a given dataset). Highly modular design allows for simple modification/augmentation. 

## Setup
>> ```Tag you're it!``` -- Galileo

To use, you must have Python 3.x + NLTK - previous version of Python will experience issues with Unicode string handling.  To install NLTK, I recommend using pip3 - run the following:
```
sudo pip3 install nltk
```
Then, simply use the run script to run the program.

## Use
>> ``` Can't put a price on these tags ``` -- Jessie J.

Place data files to be tagged into the training folder.  Run `run.sh` to tag the data and put the results into the dictionaries folder.  The default settings should be good enough for most purposes - the defaults clean most data and keep primarily only actual words.  To customize the type of data recorded, modify the arrays in `tagger_settings.py`.

## Generation
>> ``` Why learn html when this has got your tags covered``` -- Matthew Li

## Projects that use Tagger
>> ```I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's the tag that moves``` -- Rachit Agarawal
